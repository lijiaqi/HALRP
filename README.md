### Experiments

- Run HALRP on ```5-dataset``` with AlexNet/ResNet18:
```shell
bash scripts/five_AlexNet_HALRP.sh
bash scripts/five_ResNet18_HALRP.sh
```

- Run HALRP on ```TinyImageNet 20-split``` with AlexNet/Resnet18:
```shell
bash scripts/tiny20_AlexNet_HALRP.sh
bash scripts/tiny20_ResNet18_HALRP.sh
```

- Run HALRP on ```TinyImageNet 40-split``` with AlexNet/Resnet18:
```shell
bash scripts/tiny40_AlexNet_HALRP.sh
bash scripts/tiny40_ResNet18_HALRP.sh
```

- Run HALRP on ```CIFAR100-Splits/-SuperClass``` with LeNet:
```shell
### 'TRAINSIZE=1.0' means "100% of training data. 
###   Change this percentage to reproduce the results in Table 2&5 of the paper.
bash scripts/cifar100_splits100_LeNet_HALRP.sh A # (or B/C/D/E for other task orders)
bash scripts/cifar100_super100_LeNet_HALRP.sh A # (or B/C/D/E for other task orders)
```

- Run HALRP on ```PMNIST``` with LeNet:
```shell
bash scripts/pmnist_LeNet_HALRP.sh
```
